# In-Order-Traversal-Searching-in-BST
In the In-Order Traversal and Searching in BST (Binary Search Tree), I have made a structure of a node and then,
have created some nodes in the BST and linked them to each other by the help of functions.
Also I have used Iterative Method Approach inside the Search function here to Search the given Key in the BST.
